# Objectives

- To provide an authoritative resource for people wanting to know more about TRJFP,
how it works and what it involves
- To generate 'high level' academic and policy interest in the ideas underlying
the practicalities of TRJFP
- Quantify some of the benefits (e.g. energy) of TRJFP
- To generate some visualisations of data collected by TRJFP
- To explain to people how to set up new TRJFP cafes, the logistics involved and
challenges to overcome
- An anchor point to link to many of the resources that led to TRJFP

# Introduction 

The Real Junk Food Project (TRJFP) is...

TRJFP has provoked a huge volume of commentary, debate, adulation and criticism,
seemingling in equal measure. Despite the large media footprint of the project,
few have taken the time to quantify the 'real' savings that the movement has
produced. By 'real', we refer to changes that can be physically measured. That
is not to discount the importance of the project's ability to change perceptions.
Indeed, encouraging re-evaluation of the food and wider economic systems of
those who interact with TRJFP may be its most important impact. However, these
are impacts that cannot easily be measured.

The focus of this paper is on the subset of changes that TRJFP has brought
about that *can* be measured. Again, this is not to belittle to the myriad
intangible changes that have occurred as a result of the ideas inception and
rapid deployment. On the contrary, it is to help put the wider impacts of
TRJFP in perspective. For every measurable impact, for every kilogram of food
not thrown away, it is conceivable that there are a dozen changes in perception
of those directly and indirectly involved in the idea's implementation.
By focussing on what can be measured the paper aims to open the pathway
towards deeper analysis of TRJFP's wider societal impact. In order to focus on
quantifiable impacts, we must begin with the data.

# Data

TRJFP has been fortunate in that data collection was identified as a strategic
priority at its inception...

# Results 

## Global distribution and rate of spread

If TRJFP concept is to have global impact, it must be able to expand rapidly
and outstrip the growth-rates of centralised food business models
[e.g. @LondonEconomics2011].^[Although TRJFP
has 'gone viral'
in terms of dissemination ideas and branding this not lead to the
assumption that it is already competitive with the dominant centralised
business model.
It is sobering to remember that TRJFP started from a franchise of
one store in 2014 (notwithstanding other FAYF food initiatives) whereas market
leaders have a head-start of 1000s of outlets and still
continues to grow. McDonalds, for example,
is the largest restaurant franchise in Europe with > 7000 outlets
(> 18,000 worldwide) yet saw rapid growth in sales
(i.e. turnover) and capital expenditure (i.e. new stores) of 17%
between 2007 and 2010 in Europe, against a backdrop of recession.

TRJFP-affiliated restaurants have expanded rapidly (Fig. x).
Although growth has been concentrated in Europe and the US, the
brand has received exposure worldwide. The geographical spread of
TRJFP outlets is illustrated in Figure x.

## Global energy savings from TRJFP

## Waste avoided

## Increased access to nutritious food

## Case Study: Armley Junk-tion cafe

# Discussion

- Is it radical to prevent 
- It's not radical it's common sense
- Legal aspects
